# BattlegroundDataAddon
This repo contains the necessary files to run the BGDataPull World of Warcraft addon. The addon pulls all leaderboard data from a battleground once it's finished.
After leaving the battleground, use the /reload command to save this data to a local file.
If this is your first time manually installing an addon, please message me for assistance.
